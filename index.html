                <p>With my keen adaptability in any environment, working for others, brainstorming with a team, and an "active learning" mentality, 
                   it's easy to find new things to learn and be able to teach others, while also still being able to work independently. 
                   Education continues to be a passion, however, I have found a bigger passion learning how to code and program. I am 
                   currently a part time student who began a computer science degree in Spring 2022 after finishing a Bachelors of 
                   Arts in Sociology and 2 years worth of Education classes. Working in the STEM industry allows me to get students interested 
                   and understanding subjects that can be seen by many people as difficult. Through LEGO WeDo, Scratch programming, and Minecraft 
                   Code have taught children aged between 2-10 in working at exciting after school programs and summer camps. 
                   Aside from work, you can find me reading a book, practicing programming and game design by myself or with friends, practicing 
                   Spanish, playing video games, working out, or hanging out with friends and family. </p></td>

                    understanding and an interest in coding and programming as a whole between the ages of 5 and 10 years old at 
                    multiple different highly acclaimed private/charter schools in the NYC area through classes like Minecraft Code 
                    with Javascript, Lego WeDo, and Scratch. I also continue to make lesson plans for multiple levels and types of 
                    classes offered by our program.</li>
