                <p><em>Student at <strong>Queens College</strong> and STEM Instructor for <strong><a href = "https://www.codeadvantage.org/">Code Advantage</a></strong></em></p>
            
                <p>With my keen adaptability in any environment, working for others, brainstorming with a team, and an "active learning" mentality, 
                   it's easy to find new things to learn and be able to teach others, while also still being able to work independently. 
                   Education continues to be a passion, however, I have found a bigger passion learning how to code and program. I am 
                   currently a part time student who began a computer science degree in Spring 2022 after finishing a Bachelors of 
                   Arts in Sociology and 2 years worth of Education classes. Working in the STEM industry allows me to get students interested 
                   and understanding subjects that can be seen by many people as difficult. Through LEGO WeDo, Scratch programming, and Minecraft 
                   Code have taught children aged between 2-10 in working at exciting after school programs and summer camps. 
                   Aside from work, you can find me reading a book, practicing programming and game design by myself or with friends, practicing 
                   Spanish, playing video games, working out, or hanging out with friends and family. Ok Ok</p></td>
